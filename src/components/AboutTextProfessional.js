      <p> Hello, I'm Miles. It's nice to meet you. </p>
      <p>
        I'm a Web Developer, designer, and artist. I love using code to solve
        problems, and also to create meaningful, unique, and/or silly art
        projects.{" "}

        In 2018 I was a recent college graduate, and was hired to work on a
        small-scale video game called CROSSNIQ+ for Nintendo Switch. I worked
        mostly as an artist, but it was a small team, and I found myself
        intrigued by the more technical side of making games. During the course
        of the games' development, I took a couple of graduate courses in
        programming for video games and art, but I wanted a solid foundation. In
        2020 I enrolled and graduated from We Can Code It Columbus's Full Stack
        course in Java and Javascript. <p /> <br />A few months after
        graduating, I was hired at JPMorgan Chase for my first job in tech! I
        got to work on the Chase Customer Website front end, making navigation
        and creating User Interfaces. It taught me a lot, both technically, and
        about office culture and large scale corporations. Eventually, I began
        to notice my growth stagnating, and I wanted to learn new technologies,
        and work in a way that made a greater difference to my coworkers and the
        world around me. So, I left! To learn React, learn about data
        structures, build this website, and then find a new place for me to
        grow.

        I specialize in front end and UI. When I'm not coding, my hobbies are
        photography, painting, watching anime, or playing video games. I'm also
        a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community, and advocate for accessibility
        and diversity, on and off the clock.
