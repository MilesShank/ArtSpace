        When I was around 3 years old, I yanked up all of my mothers daffodils
        and tulips, and laid them on an old grate in the backyard. <br />
        As my mother glanced outside, she struggled to find the right words to
        respond to the situation, as parents of toddlers often do. I looked up
        at her, pointed at my creation and said:{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>"It's a love thing. I made it for you."</b>
      </p>
      <p>My mother, a woman of impressive tolerance and tact, said:</p>
      <p>
        <b>"Thank you, it's beautiful."</b> <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        All my life, I have created as an expression of love, though I'm happy
        to say I've developed methods of self-expression that are significantly
        more successful than destroying other peoples' flower beds.&nbsp;

        Music, drawing, painting, sculpting, they are gifts for connecting with
        others, as well as oneself. But one can find artistic connection through
        more than the typical tools of the trade. Clothing choice, intriguing
        conversation, and even computer science can all be used to convey
        sentiment and connect with others. <br />
        <br />
        In the modern era, connection happens online more often than offline.
        Reaching people and creating mutual understanding requires mastery not
        only of abstract design concepts such as balance, contrast, audience
        empathy, and emphasis, but also an understanding of how modern forums
        are built, and how social media and the internet both facilitate and
        disrupt interpersonal connections.

        I have built my life expressing love to others through whatever methods
        will reach them. Though organizationally many see programming as
        "engineering work" and creating graphics as "design work", to me they
        are 2 sides of the same coin, methods used in tandem to create
        connection, like a well played song on a well made instrument.

        So this site is me, playing with every medium I please, and showcasing
        how I connect to others, through photography, coding, drawing, design,
        video games, digital collage, and more. It is both professional and
        personal. It is the work I love to do. Thank you for engaging with it,
        and for engaging with me.
