        When I was around 2 years old, my mother glanced outside to find I had
        yanked up all of her daffodils and tulips, and laid them on an old grate
        in the backyard. <br />
        As she struggled to find the words to respond, as parents of toddlers
        often do, I looked up at her, pointed at my creation and said:{" "}
      </p>
      <p>"It's a love thing. I made it for you."</p>
      <p>
        <br />
        My mother, a woman of impressive tolerance and tact, said:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thank you, it's beautiful." <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever since, I have been creating as an expression of love, though I'm
        happy to say I've developed better mediums for communicating sentiment
        than destroying flower beds.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Music, drawing, painting, sculpting, they are gifts for connecting with
        others, as well as oneself. But artistic connection is not something
        restricted to mediums of high art. Clothing choice, intriguing
        conversation, and computer science can all be used to convey sentiment
        and connect with others. <br />
        <br />
        In the modern era, connection happens online more often than offline.
        Reaching people and creating mutual understanding requires mastery not
        only of abstract design concepts such as balance, contrast, empathy, and
        emphasis, but also an understanding of how websites are built, and how
        social media and the internet both facilitate and disrupt interpersonal
        connections.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have built my life expressing love to others through whatever methods
        will reach them. Though many see programming as "engineering work" and
        creating graphics as "design work", to me they are 2 sides of the same
        coin, methods used in tandem to create connection, like a well played
        song on a well made instrument.
      </p>
      <p>
        So this site is me, playing with every medium I please, and showcasing
        how I connect to others, through photography, coding, drawing, web
        design, video games, digital collage, and more. It is both professional
        and personal. It is the work I love to do. Thank you for engaging with
        it, and for engaging with me.
